                  Bit.leave is designed to give employees autonomy. They can choose to take time off or spend it in a way that is intrinsically rewarding to them or in alignment with their financial needs or goals. You can manually approve each cash out if you would like to put structure around its use.

                  With rules based spending you can control how and when employees can access or use bit.leave. For example, if they have excess annual leave you can set rules that encourage employees to use their excess leave first. This helps you manage leave and other balance sheet liabilities.
